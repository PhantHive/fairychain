## Introduction
This is not a serious project, just making this for fun to learn about more web3 technologies.
I have worked a bit with NFTs and smart contracts, but I want to learn more about how to build a blockchain from scratch.

# Goals
- [x] Create a simple blockchain
- [x] Create a simple proof of work algorithm and validation methods
- [] ... more to come
